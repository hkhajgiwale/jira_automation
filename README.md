Repository to the interact with Jira using CLI

# Introduction

Considering the present Agile scenario, we have so many sprints and lots of issues to work on. Sometimes it becomes hectic to login everytime over the JIRA Board and move the status of the issues, change the assignee for the issue or create the new issues. Hence I created simple python codes to ease this stuff



# Future Improvements

I am working on following improvements as of now

1. Create the ticket  using CLI
2. Bulk update the tickets with same status
3. Create the bulk tickets
4. Create the project using CLI
5. Usage of access tokens instead of username and password as soon it will be deprecated
